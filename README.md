# Raytracing
Implementing Ray tracer with 15 checkpoints

This project needs Windows Subsystem for Linux and all dependencies to compile a basic C/C++ program to compile. In addition to these there are two more dependencies you need to compile this project.

1) scon
To install: sudo apt-get install scons.

2) To install additional dependencies run this command: sudo apt-get install libpng-dev

To compile the project using the command 'scons' and in order to ensure there are really no errors or
issues running it twice should display that everything was built okay the first time.

To run the program use command './raytracer.py .'
